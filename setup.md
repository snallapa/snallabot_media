# Setting up snallabot_media

Once the bot is added to your league (see [main page](README.md)). Follow these instructions to setup the bot for your server:

1. run the `/media_export` command. This will give you the URL that you will put inside the Madden Companion App. This URL is the same everytime you run this command
2. Open the Madden Companion App on your phone
3. Find your league in the app and click on it
4. Navigate to the Export section
5. in the web url box, type in the export URL given to you. type carefully :))

## For Initial Setup or after Reset

6. Check league info, rosters, weekly stats
7. for the Export week, scroll to ALL WEEKS
8  Finally, hit Export. Try to keep your phone screen on and connected to the internet (if it fails try a couple times).

Whenever a new week advances in your league, run the following steps. It will just be faster (but you can run the above steps everytime if you like)

## For new weeks

6. Check league info, rosters, weekly stats
7. for the Export week, scroll to the week that just completed
8  Finally, hit Export. Try to keep your phone screen on and connected to the internet (if it fails try a couple times).

# Generating Media

To generate media, first configure the bot:

Run the `/setup_media` and choose the channel you would like the bot to write messages in. Make sure the bot has permissions to write to that channel!

Now, run the `/generate_media` command and choose the values you want.
